microsoft_malware
==============================

Computer infection by malware constitutes a serious security problem that could harm consumers and businesses in many different ways. The ability to predict the chances of malware infection before they occur would benefit consumers and businesses. The signal that the infection is likely to occur would allow for timely countermeasures to be applied against it. This project would benefit software manufacturers who would be able to incorporate the model into their software that would allow for additional security measures aimed at preventing the infection by malware.  
The dataset that I used for this project is provided by Microsoft and available as part of  the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data). These data include telemetry properties and infection records of Windows machines as produced by the Windows Defender software. Each row represents an individual machine. Each column represents a variable. The “HasDetections” columns of the train data indicates whether the machine is infected. The goal of the competition is to be able to predict the value of “HasDetections” column for the test data. The train data contains 8,921,483 rows and 83 columns. This is a reasonably large size dataset that allows to explore many Machine Learning techniques. The dataset was resampled such that the frequency of machines with malware approximately matches the frequency of machines without malware detected. One caveat hear is that the test set was collected later in time than the train set and therefore the accuracy metrics obtained from the train set may not necessarily match the accuracy metrics of the test set. However, the test set accuracy metrics will be a good measure of how the model would generalize to the future data. The evaluation metric for this competition was selected as area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label.
